JSON Remix

I asked ChatGPT to document some of this code, then I asked what it thought of my name. :laugh:

```
`json-remix` sounds like a great name for a library that focuses on merging or splitting JSON objects. The name "remix" implies the idea of taking existing parts and creating something new and different, which fits well with the idea of merging and splitting objects. It's also short, catchy, and easy to remember, which is always a plus. Overall, I think it's a good name choice!
